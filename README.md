# Next.js Hello World example on Porter

Forked from [nextjs/examples/hello-world](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/examples/hello-world).

This example shows the most basic idea behind Next. We have 2 pages: `pages/index.tsx` and `pages/about.tsx`. The former responds to `/` requests and the latter to `/about`. Using `next/link` you can add hyperlinks between them with universal routing capabilities. The `day` directory shows that you can have subdirectories.

## Deploy to Porter

To deploy this example to Porter, fork this repository and follow the [quickstart guide](https://docs.porter.run/language-specific-guides/nextjs).
